                Peter Parker's secret identity is revealed to the entire world. Desperate for help, Peter turns
                to Doctor Strange to make the world forget that he is Spider-Man. The spell goes horribly wrong
                and shatters the multiverse, bringing in monstrous villains that could destroy the world.

                Picking up where Far From Home left off, Peter Parker's whole world is turned upside down
                when his old enemy Mysterio posthumously reveals his identity to the public. Wanting to make
                his identity a secret, Peter turns to Doctor Strange for help. But when Strange's spell goes
                haywire, Peter must go up against five deadly new enemies--the Green Goblin, Dr. Octopus, Electro,
                the Lizard and Sandman--all while discovering what it truly means to be Spider-Man.

                With his identity compromised, right after the spectacular confrontation with super-hero charlatan
                Mysterio in Spider-Man: Far from Home (2019), Peter Parker is now with his back to the wall. On the
                run and having no one to turn to for advice, desperate Peter seeks a radical and equally dangerous
                solution to right a wrong, utterly unaware of the grave consequences of his ill-advised decision.
                And, as the unfathomable Multiverse expands with a vengeance, formidable adversaries from a not-so-distant
                past, too, seek closure, demanding the Spider's head on a platter. But when there's no way home and
                nowhere to hide, whom can Parker trust?
